{"id": 1, "title": "Reliance on Reverse DNS Resolution for a Security-Critical Action", "overview": "Since DNS names can be easily spoofed or misreported, and it may be difficult for the software to detect if a trusted DNS server has been compromised, DNS names do not constitute a valid authentication mechanism. When the software performs a reverse DNS resolution for an IP address, if an attacker controls the server for that IP address, then the attacker can cause the server to return an arbitrary hostname. As a result, the attacker may be able to bypass authentication, cause the wrong hostname to be recorded in log files to hide activities, or perform other attacks. Attackers can spoof DNS names by either (1) compromising a DNS server and modifying its records (sometimes called DNS cache poisoning), or (2) having legitimate control over a DNS server associated with their IP address.", "remediation": "::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use other means of identity verification that cannot be simply spoofed.
