Even if it is not easily accessible, the hidden functionality could be useful for attacks that modify the control flow of the application.", "remediation": "::PHASE:Installation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Always verify the integrity of the software that is being installed.::PHASE:Testing:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Conduct a code coverage analysis using live testing, then closely inspect any code that is not covered.::", "damage": 1, "reproducability": 1, "exploitability": 1, "affected_users": 1, "discoverability": 1, "dread_total": 1, "effort": null, "type": "Imported", "poc": null, "approved": true, "risk": 1, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null}
