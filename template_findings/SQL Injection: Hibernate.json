{"id": 1, "title": "SQL Injection: Hibernate", "overview": "Using Hibernate to execute a dynamic SQL statement built with user-controlled input can allow an attacker to modify the statement&amp;amp;#x27;s meaning or to execute arbitrary SQL commands.", "remediation": "::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:A non-SQL style database which is not subject to this flaw may be chosen.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Follow the principle of least privilege when creating user accounts to a SQL database. Users should only have the minimum privileges necessary to use their account. If the requirements of the system indicate that a user can read and modify their own data, then limit their privileges so they cannot read/write others&amp;#x27; data.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:For any security checks that are performed on the client side, ensure that these checks are duplicated on the server side, in order to avoid CWE-602. Attackers can bypass the client-side checks by modifying values after the checks have been performed, or by changing the client to remove the client-side checks entirely. Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Implement SQL strings using prepared statements that bind variables. Prepared statements that do not bind variables can be vulnerable to attack.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use vigorous whitelist style checking on any user input that may be used in a SQL command. Rather than escape meta-characters, it is safest to disallow them entirely. Reason: Later use of data that have been entered in the database may neglect to escape meta-characters before use. Narrowly define the set of safe characters based on the expected value of the parameter in the request.::", "damage": 1, "reproducability": 1, "exploitability": 1, "affected_users": 1, "discoverability": 1, "dread_total": 1, "effort": null, "type": "Imported", "poc": null, "approved": true, "risk": 1, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null}
