As it invokes a method in the RMI Distributed Garbage Collector which is available via every RMI endpoint, it can be used against both rmiregistry and rmid, and against most other (custom) RMI endpoints as well. Note that it does not work against Java Management Extension (JMX) ports since those do not support remote class loading, unless another RMI endpoint is active in the same Java process.</paragraph><paragraph>RMI method calls do not support or require any sort of authentication.</paragraph>", "poc": "<paragraph></paragraph>", "remediation": "<paragraph></paragraph>", "references": "https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/multi/misc/java_rmi_server.rb", "approved": true, "risk": 4, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null}]
