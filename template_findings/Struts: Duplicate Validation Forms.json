This decision might not correspond to the programmer&amp;#x27;s expectations, possibly leading to resultant weaknesses. Moreover, it indicates that the validation logic is not up-to-date, and can indicate that other, more subtle validation errors are present.", "remediation": "::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:The DTD or schema validation will not catch the duplicate occurrence of the same form name.
