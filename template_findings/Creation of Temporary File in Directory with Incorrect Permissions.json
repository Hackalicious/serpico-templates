Since the file is visible, the application that is using the temporary file could be known. If one has access to list the processes on the system, the attacker has gained information about what the user is doing at that time. By correlating this with the applications the user is running, an attacker could potentially discover what a user&amp;#x27;s actions are. From this, higher levels of security could be breached.", "remediation": "::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Many contemporary languages have functions which properly handle this condition.
