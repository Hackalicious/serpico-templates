Therefore the server is unable to determine which requests are performed by which client, and which clients are authenticated or unauthenticated.<paragraph></paragraph>The use of HTTP cookies within the headers, allows a web server to identify each individual client and can therefore determine which clients hold valid authentication, from those that do not. These are known as session cookies.<paragraph></paragraph>When a cookie is set by the server (sent the header of an HTTP response) there are several flags that can be set to configure the properties of the cookie and how it is to be handled by the browser.<paragraph></paragraph>One of these flags is known as the 'secure' flag. When the secure flag is set, the browser will prevent it from being sent over a clear text channel (HTTP) and only allow it to be sent when an encrypted channel is used (HTTPS).<paragraph></paragraph>The tool discovered that a cookie was set by the server without the secure flag being set. Although the initial setting of this cookie was via an HTTPS connection, any HTTP link to the same server will result in the cookie being send in clear text.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>The initial steps to remedy this should be determined on whether the cookie is sensitive in nature. If the cookie does not contain any sensitive information then the risk of this vulnerability is reduced; however, if the cookie does contain sensitive information, then the server should ensure that the cookie has its 'secure' flag set.</paragraph>", "references": "<paragraph>VulnDB: https://github.com/vulndb/data</paragraph><paragraph>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SecureFlag</paragraph>", "approved": true, "risk": 1, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null}]
