MIME content-sniffing is a mechanism that allows browsers to inspect and dynamically guess the content type and file type.<paragraph></paragraph>MIME Sniffing checking algorithm has known problems which might allow users to upload files that might contain malicous code. If an attacker can spoof a file type/content and upload it to the application successfully, it is possible to inject malicous code which can be downloaded and viewed by other users of the application. This can lead to attacks such as persistant Cross-Site Scripting.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>'X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff' header should be implemented which allows a web server to force the browser into disabling MIME Sniffing for a served file. The nosniff option will only load any external resource if the content-type maches what is expected of the file type.</paragraph>", "references": "<paragraph>VulnDB: https://github.com/vulndb/data</paragraph><paragraph>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg622941(v=vs.85).aspx</paragraph>", "approved": true, "risk": 2, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null}]
