{"id": 1, "title": "Improper Null Termination", "overview": "Null termination errors frequently occur in two different ways. An off-by-one error could cause a null to be written out of bounds, leading to an overflow. Or, a program could use a strncpy() function call incorrectly, which prevents a null terminator from being added at all. Other scenarios are possible.", "remediation": "::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use a language that is not susceptible to these issues. However, be careful of null byte interaction errors (CWE-626) with lower-level constructs that may be written in a language that is susceptible.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Ensure that all string functions used are understood fully as to how they append null characters. Also, be wary of off-by-one errors when appending nulls to the end of strings.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:If performance constraints permit, special code can be added that validates null-termination of string buffers, this is a rather naive and error-prone solution.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Switch to bounded string manipulation functions. Inspect buffer lengths involved in the buffer overrun trace reported with the defect.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Add code that fills buffers with nulls (however, the length of buffers still needs to be inspected, to ensure that the non null-terminated string is not written at the physical end of the buffer).::", "damage": 1, "reproducability": 1, "exploitability": 1, "affected_users": 1, "discoverability": 1, "dread_total": 1, "effort": null, "type": "Imported", "poc": null, "approved": true, "risk": 1, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null}
