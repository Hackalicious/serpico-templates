CORS allows the browser to perform HTTP requests to a domain outside the Same-Origin Policy and access the response body. This feature is secured by a new set of HTTP headers, being 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' one of the most important ones. <paragraph></paragraph> It was possible to identify an HTTP response which contained the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header value set to '*', which allows any third-party domain to perform requests and read the responses. While this configuration is not a vulnerability per-se, it's only recommended for sites which provide information that's public such as weather or stock prices.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>All CORS requests include the 'Origin' header which indicates the source domain name.
