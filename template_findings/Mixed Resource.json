To keep data private and prevent it from being intercepted, HTTP is often tunnelled through either a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), or Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection. When either of these encryption standards are used, it is referred to as HTTPS.<paragraph></paragraph>Cyber-criminals will often attempt to compromise sensitive information passed from the client to the server using HTTP. This can be conducted via various different Man-in-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks or through network packet captures.<paragraph></paragraph>The tool discovered that the affected site is utilising both HTTP and HTTPS. While the HTML code is served over HTTPS, the server is also serving resources over an unencrypted channel, which can lead to the compromise of data, while providing a false sense of security to the user.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>All pages and/or resources on the affected site should be secured equally, utilising the latest and most secure encryption protocols. These include SSL version 3.0 and TLS version 1.2.<paragraph></paragraph>While TLS 1.2 is the latest and the most preferred protocol, not all browsers will support this encryption method. Therefore, the more common SSL is included. Older protocols such as SSL version 2, and weak ciphers (< 128 bit) should also be disabled.</paragraph>", "references": "<paragraph>VulnDB: https://github.com/vulndb/data</paragraph><paragraph>http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/06/trying-to-end-mixed-scripting.html</paragraph>", "approved": true, "risk": 3, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null}]
