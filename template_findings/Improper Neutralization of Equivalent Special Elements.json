However, there may be alternate encodings, or representations that also have the same meaning. For example, the software may filter out a leading slash (/) to prevent absolute path names, but does not account for a tilde (~) followed by a user name, which on some *nix systems could be expanded to an absolute pathname. Alternately, the software might filter a dangerous -e command-line switch when calling an external program, but it might not account for --exec or other switches that have the same semantics.", "remediation": "::PHASE:Requirements:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Programming languages and supporting technologies might be chosen which are not subject to these issues.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Utilize an appropriate mix of whitelist and blacklist parsing to filter equivalent special element syntax from all input.::", "damage": 1, "reproducability": 1, "exploitability": 1, "affected_users": 1, "discoverability": 1, "dread_total": 1, "effort": null, "type": "Imported", "poc": null, "approved": true, "risk": 1, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null}
