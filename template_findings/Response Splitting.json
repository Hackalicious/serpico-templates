This is abused by cyber-criminals injecting CR (Carriage Return -- '/r') and LF (Line Feed -- '\n') characters which will then form the split. If the CR or LF characters are not processed by the server then it cannot be exploited.<paragraph></paragraph>Along with these characters, cyber-criminals can then construct their own arbitrary response headers and body which would then form the second response. The second response is entirely under their control, allowing for a number of other attacks.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>It is recommended that untrusted data is never used to form the contents of the response header.<paragraph></paragraph>Where any untrusted source is required to be used in the response headers, it is important to ensure that any hazardous characters ('/r', '/n' and potentially others) are sanitised prior to being used.<paragraph></paragraph>This is especially important when setting cookie values, redirecting, etc..</paragraph>", "references": "<paragraph>VulnDB: https://github.com/vulndb/data</paragraph><paragraph>http://www.securiteam.com/securityreviews/5WP0E2KFGK.html</paragraph><paragraph>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Response_Splitting</paragraph>", "approved": true, "risk": 3, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null}]
