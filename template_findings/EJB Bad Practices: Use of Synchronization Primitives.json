In this case, the program violates the following EJB guideline: An enterprise bean must not use thread synchronization primitives to synchronize execution of multiple instances. The specification justifies this requirement in the following way: This rule is required to ensure consistent runtime semantics because while some EJB containers may use a single JVM to execute all enterprise bean&amp;#x27;s instances, others may distribute the instances across multiple JVMs.", "remediation": "::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Do not use Synchronization Primitives when writing EJBs.::", "damage": 1, "reproducability": 1, "exploitability": 1, "affected_users": 1, "discoverability": 1, "dread_total": 1, "effort": null, "type": "Imported", "poc": null, "approved": true, "risk": 1, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null}
