The URL policy file for Silverlight is located, by default, in the root directory of the target server, with the name 'crossdomain.xml' (for example, at 'www.example.com/crossdomain.xml'). When a domain is specified in 'crossdomain.xml', the site declares that it is willing to allow the operators of any servers in that domain to obtain any document on the server where the policy file resides.<paragraph></paragraph>The 'crossdomain.xml' file deployed on this website opens the server to all domains (use of a single asterisk \"*\" as a pure wildcard is supported).</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>Carefully evaluate which sites will be allowed to make cross-domain calls.<paragraph></paragraph>Consider network topology and any authentication mechanisms that will be affected by the configuration or implementation of the cross-domain policy.</paragraph>", "references": "<paragraph>VulnDB: https://github.com/vulndb/data</paragraph><paragraph>http://blogs.adobe.com/stateofsecurity/2007/07/crossdomain_policy_files_1.html</paragraph><paragraph>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Test_Cross_Origin_Resource_Sharing_%28OTG-CLIENT-007%29</paragraph>", "approved": true, "risk": 2, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null}]
