{"id": 1, "title": "Addition of Data Structure Sentinel", "overview": "Data-structure sentinels are often used to mark the structure of data. A common example of this is the null character at the end of strings or a special sentinel to mark the end of a linked list. It is dangerous to allow this type of control data to be easily accessible. Therefore, it is important to protect from the addition or modification of sentinels.", "remediation": "::PHASE:Implementation Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Encapsulate the user from interacting with data sentinels. Validate user input to verify that sentinels are not present.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Proper error checking can reduce the risk of inadvertently introducing sentinel values into data. For example, if a parsing function fails or encounters an error, it might return a value that is the same as the sentinel.::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. This is not a complete solution.::PHASE:Operation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Use OS-level preventative functionality.
