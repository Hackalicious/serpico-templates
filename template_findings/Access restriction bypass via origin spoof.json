Occasionally, poorly implemented access restrictions are based off of the originating IP address alone.<paragraph></paragraph>For example, any public IP address may be forced to authenticate, while an internal IP address may not. Because this header can also be set by the client, it allows cyber-criminals to spoof their IP address and potentially gain access to restricted pages.<paragraph></paragraph>The tool discovered a resource that it did not have permission to access, but been granted access after spoofing the address of localhost (127.0.0.1), thus bypassing any requirement to authenticate.</paragraph>", "poc": null, "remediation": "<paragraph>Remediation actions may be vastly different depending on the framework being used, and how the application has been coded.
