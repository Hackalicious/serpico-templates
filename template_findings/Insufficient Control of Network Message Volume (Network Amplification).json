Systems can often be configured to restrict the amount of traffic sent out on behalf of a client, based on the client&amp;#x27;s origin or access level. This is usually defined in a resource allocation policy. In the absence of a mechanism to keep track of transmissions, the system or application can be easily abused to transmit asymmetrically greater traffic than the request or client should be permitted to.", "remediation": "::PHASE:Architecture and Design:STRATEGY:Separation of Privilege:EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:An application must make network resources available to a client commensurate with the client&amp;#x27;s access level.::PHASE:Policy:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:Define a clear policy for network resource allocation and consumption.::PHASE:Implementation:STRATEGY::EFFECTIVENESS::DESCRIPTION:An application must, at all times, keep track of network resources and meter their usage appropriately.::", "damage": 1, "reproducability": 1, "exploitability": 1, "affected_users": 1, "discoverability": 1, "dread_total": 1, "effort": null, "type": "Imported", "poc": null, "approved": true, "risk": 1, "affected_hosts": null, "av": null, "ac": null, "au": null, "c": null, "i": null, "a": null, "e": null, "rl": null, "rc": null, "cdp": null, "td": null, "cr": null, "ir": null, "ar": null, "cvss_base": null, "cvss_impact": null, "cvss_exploitability": null, "cvss_temporal": null, "cvss_environmental": null, "cvss_modified_impact": null, "cvss_total": null, "ease": null}
